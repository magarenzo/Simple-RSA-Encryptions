# SimpleRSAEncryptions

Encrypt input using RSA

## About

[*RSAEncryptionSequence.java*](src/RSAEncryptionSequence.java) is a class in which the input is encrypted using a public key and is decrypted using a private key, as according to the RSA algorithm.

[*RandomPrimesRSAEncryption.java*](src/RandomPrimesRSAEncryption.java) is another class that uses randomly generated prime numbers to encrypt the input. 

## Output

#### RSAEncryptionSequence.java
